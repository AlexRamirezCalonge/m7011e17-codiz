This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

[CodiZ]

The main purpose of the project is offer a quiz platform about programming. In this one, the user should introduce a nickname to start the quiz. All the questions will be stored in a database and when the quiz starts the platform will choose 10 different questions. Each correct question will give 1 point and, at the end of the quiz, he will be able to see his punctuation. That will be the main functionality, but in new versions we would like to introduce new questions and tools.
To the front-end and back-end development we will use ReactJS and Java Spring respectively. MariaDB for the database and Heroku to deploy the app.
